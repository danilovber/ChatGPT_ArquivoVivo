Subject: Withdrawal of Manuscript Submission

Dear Dr. Danilo V Bernardo,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you of my decision to withdraw the submission of my manuscript titled [Title of Your Manuscript], which was under consideration for publication in your journal. After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I am unable to proceed with the publication process due to financial constraints.

While I appreciate the positive review comments received and the efforts of the editorial team, I regret to inform you that I am unable to cover the publication fees required for my article. As an author, I am committed to principles of academic integrity and ethical publishing practices. Participating in journals that require author fees, particularly those with practices that may be perceived as predatory, goes against my principles and beliefs regarding the advancement of scientific knowledge.

Therefore, I must respectfully decline the invitation to proceed with the publication of my manuscript under the terms outlined in your recent communication. I trust you understand my position on this matter.

I will be exploring other venues for publication that align with my values and requirements, particularly those that do not impose publication fees on authors. I am confident that I will find a suitable journal where my work can be evaluated and disseminated in a manner that upholds the integrity of scholarly research.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter. I appreciate the opportunity to have considered your journal for the publication of my research.

Warm regards,

Subject: Formal Withdrawal of Manuscript Submission

Dear Dr. Danilo V Bernardo,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to reiterate my previous request to withdraw the submission of my manuscript titled [Title of Your Manuscript], which was under consideration for publication in your esteemed journal.

As previously communicated, I am unable to proceed with the publication process due to financial constraints. I want to emphasize that I do not have the means to cover any publication fees, regardless of the amount. Therefore, I must respectfully decline the invitation to proceed with the publication of my manuscript under the terms outlined in your recent communication.

Furthermore, I want to express my discomfort with the practice of author-paid publication models, which I believe can be detrimental to the integrity and advancement of scientific research. As an author, I am committed to upholding ethical standards in scholarly publishing, and I cannot in good conscience participate in journals that require authors to pay for publication.

I appreciate the efforts of the editorial team and the positive review comments received on my manuscript. However, it is imperative for me to adhere to my principles regarding publication practices.

I kindly request that you acknowledge the withdrawal of my submission and refrain from any further processing related to the publication of my manuscript in your journal.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust you understand my position, and I appreciate your cooperation.

Warm regards,
